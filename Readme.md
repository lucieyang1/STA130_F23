2. [10-12 hours] Create your first homework/tutorial set

   - Rohan
      - Addressing the "Why use 2 indicator variable if there are three categories?" question in tutorial/homework be might a good content piece
      - where are rows/observations addressed?
   - Cole
      - `graphviz` was not working on jupyterhub during the Week 11 video recording; and, I spent the last 45 minutes of a 2 hour 45 minute recording to not get model complexity selection with `GridSearchCV` working. 
      - `graphviz` is now available ... I plan to (soon?) add a recording about model complexity, test/training data, generalizability with `GridSearchCV` (which I will figure out how to use for the recording).  This recording will also begin with a review of decision tree visualization based on `graphviz` now working and should be a good way to pick up from the last recording (which got cut off at around 2 hours).
      - It seems you and Steve have a good idea about the ethics topics that you can address; and/but, it seems to me that reproducibility/generalizability as seen through the lense of `GridSearchCV` and training/test data would nonetheless be a good topic to return to for week 12(?).
         - So, there are definitley options options for what to do in the last class between concluding with the generalizability `GridSearchCV` topics and ethics; though, this all seems likely to mean that the idea of doing a review on the last class will disappear (which is okay from my perspective). 
         - It seems likely that introducing reproducibility->algorithmic bias (while an interesting ethics topic that I think ties in to "out of sample performance" likely won't have time to make an appearance in the last class... and that seems okay to me... although, perhaps it could be introduced as a homework topic?)
      -  With all of this in mind I don't think you are very time rich in that last class as I initially thought... I'm okay with that though and I'm not particularly committed to using the last class for a review of any sort... happy to leave that to the students and their study groups... 
      -  It seems to me that this week is not particularly finalized and will require a descent amount of determination still... I do think there's still a good amount of opportunity and freedom in determining what should be done with this last class... that kinda just depends on what feels good to you and what you end up suggesting we do, I think (perhaps maybe).
