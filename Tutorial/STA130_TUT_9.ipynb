    "Suppose we are designing a classification model for reviewing applications to a prestigious medical school, with the goal of predicting the likelihood that they will graduate, which would then be used to determine who should be admitted. Using the framework discussed, please answer the following two questions:\n",
    "1. Consider the following information: {undergraduate GPA, MCAT score, volunteer activity, criminal history, marriage status (including common law), age}. \n",
    "- Sort the information into informations which is ethically appropriate or inappropriate to take into consideration whether to admit someone.\n",
    "- For each bit of information that you think is ethically inappropriate to take into consideration, explain why you think it is inappropriate, by picking one of the following options and expanding on it in a couple sentences:  \n",
    "    1. Taking it into consideration would produce more harm than benefit overall. \n",
    "    2. Taking it into consideration would violate someone’s rights. \n",
    "    3. Taking it into consideration would be ethically wrong for some other reason. \n",
    "2. Which metric or metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) should you prioritize in judging the performance of your model? How is your answer different from the mortgage company case discussed in tutorial?"
