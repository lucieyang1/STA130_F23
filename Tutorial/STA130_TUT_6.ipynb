    "There are multiple studies exploring the relationship between gratitude journaling and life satisfaction, mental health, adjusting to university and more. An example of gratitude journaling is writing down three things that you are thankful for at the end of the day. We might all be able to benefit from this science-backed way to live more satisfying lives. To learn more, check out this 10-minute video [An antidote to dissatisfaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPPPFqsECz0) from the Kurzgesagt YouTube channel.  To hear a little bit more about mental health more generally, check out this 20-minute TED talk [This could be why you're depressed or anxious](https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_this_could_be_why_you_re_depressed_or_anxious?language=en) by Johann Hari."

    "The data this week is synthetic, but is loosely based on a study of students in their first year of a five-year college in Turkey. Specifically, 61 Turkish students in their first year of college were randomly assigned to either practice gratitude journaling for three weeks (treatment group, n=30) or to write down a factual account of their day for three weeks (control group, n=31). At the end of the three week period, their life satisfaction (on a scale from 0 to 100) was measured as was their adjustment to university life (on a scale from 48 to 336, where scores over 144 are considered to indicate successful adjustment while scores lower than this indicate difficulties with adjusting).

Researchers were interested in determining whether the average duration of exercise differed between people who consume cannabis and those who do not consume cannabis. Assume the researchers who conducted this study found that people who used cannabis exercised, on average, 20 minutes per week. In contrast, people who did not use cannabis exercised 40 minutes per week, on average. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.249."

The researchers used a birth registry of all children born in Ontario in 2018, which included approximately 130,000 births. The researchers found that 0.6% of mothers reported that their babies have developmental disabilities and 56% of babies born to mothers who consumed alcohol at least once during pregnancy. In contrast, 55% of healthy babies were born to mothers who were not exposed to alcohol. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.50."
